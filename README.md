## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mGd5VpbO4JnzU6I9l96x) was to build an application to complete the given user stories:

- When I select the items tab, I can see a list of items under different categories.
- I can add a new item with name, category, note, and image.
- When I add a new item, I can select one from the existing categories or add a new one if the category does not exist
- When I select an item, I can see its details and I can choose to add the current list or delete the item.
- I can add items to the current list
- I can increase the number of item in the list
- I can remove the item from the list
- I can save/update the list with a name (user can have only one active list at a time)
- I can toggle between editing state and completing state
- When I am at completing state, I can save my progress by selecting the item
- I can cancel the active list
- When I try to cancel a list, I can see a confirmation notification
- I can see my shopping history and I can see the details of it
- I can see some statistics: top items, top categories, and monthly comparison. (Tips: use libraries like recharts for the graph)
- (optional): I can search for items
